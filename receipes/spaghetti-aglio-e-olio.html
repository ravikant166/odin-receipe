        <p>No two spaghetti aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key
            is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden-brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you
            don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti </li>
                <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced </li>
                <li>½ cup olive oil </li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste </li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
                <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley </li>
                <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring
                    occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a
                    pasta bowl.</li>
                <li>Combine garlic and olive oil in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about
                    10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is
                    golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Stir red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt into the pasta. Pour in olive oil and garlic, and
                    sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; stir until combined.</li>
                <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
            </ol>
